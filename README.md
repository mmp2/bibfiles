# bibfiles
A safe place for my bib files
-----------------------------
Why? It seems that overleaf overwrites the bib labels. A few years ago I created some .bib masterfiles and placed them in a repository shared with my students. Some time later I discovered that the original labels had been rewritten. I couldn't reuse text from older grants, reports, papers, courses, because all the bib references were broken and I had to search by hand to figure out what was what. This was unexpected, but also irrecoverable. 

Now I am starting to move all my bib files here and keep the master files here where only I have writing rights. The necessary refs will be copied where ever they are needed. This also matches the way my current students work. 

**TODO**
  * copy all bib files here, with all available versions
  * mmp.bib -- has lots of versions, and not long ago I merged them in one. So maybe I will not upload all versions here. Currently no version is here. maramu: master version in Papers/mmp.bib,  with Research/samk-gradients/mygit  a close second, with mangled labels. Closest competitors: madrid/Papers/mmp.bib and maybe crc-proposal on maramu??
  * gradually merge all versions into one, saving the old labels whenever possible
  * ensure that additions to each bib file are copied back.

**2 feb 2025** repo created, some bib files added
