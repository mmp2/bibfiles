              large and complex data sets. However, such algorithms still
              encounter challenges when faced with real data. One such
              challenge is the existence of ``repeated eigendirections,'' which
              obscures the detection of the true dimensionality of the
              underlying manifold and arises when several embedding coordinates
              parametrize the same direction in the intrinsic geometry of the

              regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to
              repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious
              embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique
              eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps
              embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard
              diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and
              flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets. We then apply
              our algorithm to data collected from a stochastic model of
              cellular chemotaxis, where our approach for factoring out

              extract relevant information from raw data. Recently, AI has also
              found use in enhancing the efficiency of molecular simulations,
              wherein AI derived slow modes are used to accelerate the
              simulation in targeted ways. However, while typical fields where
              AI is used are characterized by a plethora of data, molecular
              simulations, per construction, suffer from limited sampling and
              thus limited data. As such, the use of AI in molecular
              simulations can suffer from a dangerous situation where the
              AI-optimization could get stuck in spurious regimes, leading to
              incorrect characterization of the reaction coordinate (RC) for
              the problem at hand. When such an incorrect RC is then used to
              perform additional simulations, one could start to deviate

              spurious AI-solutions, here, we report a novel and automated
              algorithm using ideas from statistical mechanics. It is based on
              the notion that a more reliable AI-solution will be one that
              maximizes the timescale separation between slow and fast
              processes. To learn this timescale separation even from limited
              data, we use a maximum caliber-based framework. We show the
              applicability of this automatic protocol for three classic
              benchmark problems, namely, the conformational dynamics of a
              model peptide, ligand-unbinding from a protein, and
              folding/unfolding energy landscape of the C-terminal domain of

               from efficient energy harvesting and storage to uncovering novel
               pharmaceutical drug candidates. Traditionally matter
               engineering--generally denoted as inverse design--was based
               massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual
               screening. The last few years have seen the emergence of
               significant interest in computer-inspired designs based on

               is that the standard strings molecular representation SMILES

               fractions of strings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here,
               we solve this problem at a fundamental level and introduce
               SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings), a string-based

  abstract  = "It is the purpose of this paper to describe some recent
               developments in the semiclassical approximations to quantum
               vibrational dynamics. In section 1 we describe a new and very
               simple method for finding uniformized semiclassical
               wavefunctions. The wavefunctions are given explicity as
               contractions over Gaussian functions, with the parameters of the
               Gaussians chosen according to an arbitrary classical trajectory.
               The semiclassical functions moreover are highly suitable for use
               as basis functions in ab initio work. In section 2 we present
               new results for the quantum dynamics of a highly anharmonic
               classically chaotic system with an infinite number of quantum
               bound states. The results show the utility of the spectral
               criterion we have been advocating as a measure of phase-space
               flow in molecular systems, and they show some interesting
               quantum effects. Also, we show that the classical and quantum
               dynamics of a local-mode C---H stretch agree extremely well as
               to the fraction of available phase space covered in the course
               of the subsequent dynamics. In quantum-mechanical systems the
               optical spectrum gives a direct measure of this fraction.",

               for k labelled points in Rm was given by Kendall for the
               atypically simple situations in which m = 1 or 2 and k $\geq$ 2.
               Here we deal with the general case (m $\geq$ 1, k $\geq$ 2) by
               using the properties of Riemannian submersions and warped
               products as studied by O'Neill. The approach is via the
               associated size-and-shape space that is the warped product of
               the shape space and the half-line R+ (carrying size), the
               warping function being equal to the square of the size. When
               combined with parallel studies by Le of the corresponding global
               geodesic geometry, the results obtained here determine the
               environment in which shape-statistical calculations have to be
               acted out. Finally three different applications are discussed

              of functional materials is essential for the design of next
              generation materials to tackle global energy and environmental
              challenges. Many of these processes involve the dynamics of
              individual atoms or small molecules in condensed phases, e.g.
              lithium ions in electrolytes, water molecules in membranes,
              molten atoms at interfaces, etc., which are difficult to
              understand due to the complexity of local environments. In this
              work, we develop graph dynamical networks, an unsupervised
              learning approach for understanding atomic scale dynamics in
              arbitrary phases and environments from molecular dynamics
